       Buckets vs Databases: Usage & Differences
====================

INTRODUCTION:
Buckets and Databases are two fundamental storage solutions in modern computing. While both store data, their structure, purpose, and use cases differ significantly.

====================
WHERE BUCKETS ARE USED:
- Object storage for files, images, videos.
- Backup and archival solutions.
- Static website hosting.
- Big data analytics storage.

====================
WHERE DATABASES ARE USED:
- Structured data storage.
- Transactional systems (e.g., banking).
- Real-time analytics.
- Applications requiring relational or NoSQL data models.

====================
KEY DIFFERENCES:
- Buckets store objects; Databases store structured records.
- Buckets are ideal for unstructured data; Databases for structured data.
- Buckets scale horizontally easily; Databases require complex scaling.

====================
ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES:
Buckets:
  + Highly scalable and cost-effective.
  + Great for large files and backups.
  - Not suitable for complex queries.
Databases:
  + Excellent for structured queries and transactions.
  + Supports indexing and relationships.
  - Scaling can be expensive and complex.

====================
REAL-WORLD USE CASES:
- Buckets: AWS S3 for storing media files.
- Databases: MySQL for e-commerce transactions.

====================
SUMMARY:
Choose Buckets for object storage and Databases for structured, relational data.
