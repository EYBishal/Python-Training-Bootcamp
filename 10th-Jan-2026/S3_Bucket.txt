====================

INTRODUCTION:
AWS S3 buckets are a cornerstone of cloud storage, offering multiple storage classes for different needs.

====================
DEFINITION:
An AWS bucket is a container for storing objects in Amazon S3 service.

====================
TYPES OF BUCKETS:
1. S3 Standard:
   - Use Case: Frequently accessed data.
   - Advantages: High durability, low latency.
   - Disadvantages: Higher cost for infrequent access.

2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
   - Use Case: Data with unpredictable access patterns.
   - Advantages: Automatic cost optimization.
   - Disadvantages: Slight overhead for monitoring.

3. S3 Glacier:
   - Use Case: Archival storage.
   - Advantages: Extremely low cost.
   - Disadvantages: Retrieval takes hours.

4. S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
   - Use Case: Long-term archival.
   - Advantages: Cheapest storage.
   - Disadvantages: Retrieval is very slow.

====================
ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES:
- Advantages: Scalability, durability, global availability.
- Disadvantages: Retrieval delays for archival classes.

====================
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPES:
- Standard vs Glacier: Speed vs Cost.
- Intelligent-Tiering vs Standard: Automation vs Manual management.

====================
REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES:
- Media companies use S3 Standard for streaming content.
- Healthcare uses Glacier for storing patient records long-term.

====================
SUMMARY:
AWS buckets provide flexible storage options tailored to cost and performance needs.
