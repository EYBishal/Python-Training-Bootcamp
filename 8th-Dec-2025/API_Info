API
---------
---------
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
APIs enable the exchange of data, features, and functionality between applications, simplifying and accelerating software development.

 Why APIs are important?

Enable integration – Connect different applications and services.
Simplify development – Developers don’t need to know internal logic, just use endpoints.
Promote reusability – Same API can be used by multiple clients.
Support scalability – Helps build modular and distributed systems.


✅ Types of APIs

REST API – Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
SOAP API – XML-based protocol for structured communication.
GraphQL API – Flexible query-based API.
WebSocket API – For real-time communication.

HTTP REQUESTS
-------------
-------------
.Enable communication – They allow clients (browsers, apps) to talk to servers.
.Data exchange – Used to send and receive data between client and server.
.Web functionality – Power all web operations like loading pages, submitting forms, fetching APIs.
.Standard protocol – Provide a universal way to interact over the internet.
.Support CRUD operations – Enable Create, Read, Update, Delete actions via methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
.Foundation of REST APIs – Essential for modern web and mobile applications.
.The four basic HTTP request types most commonly used in web development (especially in REST APIs) are:

GET –
-----

Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.
Characteristics:
Should not change server data (safe).
Can be cached.
Parameters are usually sent in the URL query string.
Example: Fetching a list of users.

POST –
------

Purpose: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
Characteristics:
Changes server state.
Data is sent in the request body.
Example: Submitting a form to create a new account.

PUT –
------

Purpose: Update an existing resource (or create it if it doesn’t exist).
Characteristics:
Replaces the entire resource with the provided data.
Idempotent (repeating the same request results in the same state).
Example: Updating a user’s profile information.

DELETE –
--------

Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.
Characteristics:
Changes server state.
Idempotent.
Example: Deleting a blog post


STATUS CODE
-----------
-----------

HTTP status codes are essential for indicating the outcome of a client's request to a server,
helping to communicate whether the request was successful or if an error occurred.

.Indicate request outcome – Tell if the request was successful or failed.
.Standard communication – Provide a universal language between client and server.
.Error identification – Help developers debug issues quickly.
.Guide client actions – Inform whether to retry, redirect, or authenticate.
.Improve user experience – Enable meaningful error messages for users.
.Enable automation – Allow apps to handle responses programmatically.

1xx: Informational

100 Continue – The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send the request body.
101 Switching Protocols – The server is switching protocols as requested by the client.


✅ 2xx: Success

200 OK – The request was successful.
201 Created – The request was successful, and a new resource was created.
204 No Content – The request was successful, but there is no content to return.


✅ 3xx: Redirection

301 Moved Permanently – The resource has been moved to a new URL permanently.
302 Found – The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
304 Not Modified – The resource has not changed since the last request.


✅ 4xx: Client Errors

400 Bad Request – The server cannot process the request due to client error.
401 Unauthorized – Authentication is required and has failed or not been provided.
403 Forbidden – The client does not have permission to access the resource.
404 Not Found – The requested resource could not be found.
405 Method Not Allowed – The HTTP method is not supported for the resource.


✅ 5xx: Server Errors

500 Internal Server Error – A generic error occurred on the server.
502 Bad Gateway – The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable – The server is temporarily unavailable (e.g., overloaded or down for maintenance).
504 Gateway Timeout – The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.
